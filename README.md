# RTL2GDS_MyJourney
ðŸš€ A hands-on journey from RTL to GDSII with open-source EDA tools. This repo documents my work in the VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program, covering synthesis, simulation, floorplanning, placement, routing, and sign-off checks. It serves as both a learning log and a reference for ASIC design with OpenLane.

# RTL2GDS_MyJourney
🚀 A hands-on journey from RTL to GDSII with open-source EDA tools. This repo documents my work in the VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program, covering synthesis, simulation, floorplanning, placement, routing, and sign-off checks. It serves as both a learning log and a reference for ASIC design with OpenLane.

Welcome to my repository! 🎉  
This project documents my hands-on experience with the RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program (VSD).  

👉 The goal: take a design from 🔴 RTL Design ➝ 🔵 Synthesis ➝ 🟣 Physical Design ➝ 🎯 Tapeout Ready
 using **open-source tools** only.  


🌱 Week 0 – Foundation Week  

 *Environment Setup + Tool Installation* 🛠️  

Before designing silicon, the lab needs its instruments!  
This week focused on setting up the **complete RTL-to-GDSII toolchain**.  

✅ Tasks Completed  

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Task 0 | Install & verify the full EDA toolkit | ✔ Done |

🔧 Tools Installed & Verified  

| Tool | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Yosys** | RTL synthesis & logic optimization | ✅ Verified |
| **Icarus Verilog** | Verilog compilation & simulation | ✅ Verified |
| **GTKWave** | Waveform viewing & debugging | ✅ Verified |
| **Ngspice** | Analog & mixed-signal simulation | ✅ Verified |
